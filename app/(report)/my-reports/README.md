# My Reports Page Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring of the large `page.tsx` file into smaller, more manageable components and custom hooks.

## Structure Overview

### Original File
- **Size**: 921 lines
- **Issues**: Large monolithic component with multiple responsibilities, difficult to maintain and test

### Refactored Structure

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Hooks can be shared across different report-related pages

### 3. **Testability**
- Smaller components are easier to unit test
- Hooks can be tested independently
- Clear input/output boundaries

### 4. **Performance**
- Better code splitting opportunities
- Memoized calculations in hooks
- Reduced re-renders with focused state management

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Easier to understand and modify
- Better code navigation
- Cleaner imports with index files

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None - the refactored version maintains the same API and functionality

### New Features Added
- Index files for cleaner imports
- Better TypeScript interfaces
- Improved error handling structure

### Files to Review
- All new component files for styling consistency
- Hook implementations for business logic accuracy
- Main page.tsx for proper integration

## Future Improvements

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create tests for each component and hook
2. **Storybook Integration**: Add stories for visual component testing
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add React.memo where appropriate
4. **Accessibility**: Enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Error Boundaries**: Add error boundaries around major component sections
