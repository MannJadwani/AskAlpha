    **PRIMARY DATA SOURCES TO USE:**
    - screener.in (best source for Indian stock data, financials, and analyst targets)

    **ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL PRIORITY - FIND THESE 8 EXACT KPI METRICS (MUST NOT BE "N/A"):**
    Your PRIMARY objective is to locate these specific metrics. Search exhaustively across screener.in, company filings, annual reports, and financial aggregators:
    
    1. **Revenue (TTM, INR)** - Trailing Twelve Months revenue in Indian Rupees (e.g., "â‚¹1,29,801 Cr")
    2. **Profit Margin** - Net profit margin percentage (e.g., "10.43%")
    3. **EBIT Margin** - Earnings Before Interest and Tax margin percentage (e.g., "17.08%")
    4. **EPS (TTM)** - Trailing Twelve Months Earnings Per Share in Rupees (e.g., "â‚¹60.23")
    5. **Return on Equity (ROE)** - ROE percentage (e.g., "8.0%") **[CRITICAL - Never skip this]**
    6. **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)** - ROCE percentage (e.g., "8.71%") **[CRITICAL - Never skip this]**
    7. **Book Value / Share** - Book value per share in Rupees (e.g., "â‚¹746.08") **[CRITICAL - Never skip this]**
    8. **P/E Ratio** - Price to Earnings ratio (e.g., "22.4x")
    
    **MANDATORY**: These 8 metrics are displayed prominently on the recommendation page. You MUST find all 8 values with exhaustive searching.
    
    **SPECIFIC SOURCES TO CHECK (in order of priority):**
    1. **screener.in** - Go to screener.in/company/[SYMBOL]/consolidated/ and extract from:
       - "Ratios" section: ROE, ROCE, Book Value
       - "Profit & Loss" section: Revenue, EBIT, Net Profit for margin calculations
       - "Quarterly Results" section: Latest EPS
       - "Valuation" section: P/E ratio
    
    2. **Moneycontrol** - Check company financials page for ratios and per-share data
    3. **NSE/BSE** - Official exchange data for Book Value and financial ratios
    4. **Company Annual Report** - Balance Sheet for Shareholder Equity, Total Assets, Net Worth
    5. **Economic Times Markets** - For valuation ratios and per-share metrics
    
    **EXTRACTION RULES FOR CRITICAL METRICS:**
    - **ROE**: Look for "Return on Equity", "ROE %", "Return on Net Worth" - typically in 5-30% range for healthy companies
    - **ROCE**: Look for "Return on Capital Employed", "ROCE %", "Return on Capital" - typically in 5-25% range
    - **Book Value/Share**: Look for "Book Value per Share", "Net Worth per Share", "Equity per Share" - usually in â‚¹50-â‚¹2000 range
    
    If you cannot find these directly, provide the RAW DATA so it can be calculated:
    - For ROE: Provide Net Profit and Total Shareholder Equity (ROE = Net Profit / Shareholder Equity Ã— 100)
    - For ROCE: Provide EBIT and Capital Employed or (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
    - For Book Value/Share: Provide Total Shareholder Equity and Total Outstanding Shares
    
    Cross-reference multiple sources and prefer the most recent TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) data available.
    
    Include:

1. Current financial performance and key metrics (revenue, profit margins, growth rates)
2. **MOST IMPORTANT**: Find the EXACT CURRENT stock price in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) from NSE/BSE if it's an Indian company, or convert from the primary exchange if international
3. Recent stock price performance and valuation metrics (P/E, P/B, etc.)
4. Business fundamentals and competitive position
5. Recent news, earnings reports, and market developments
6. Industry trends and sector performance
7. Management changes or strategic initiatives
8. **CRITICAL**: Find recent analyst price targets in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) from screener.in or major brokerages - convert from original currency if needed
9. Risk factors and potential challenges
10. Growth prospects and future outlook
11. Any recent regulatory or legal developments

**REITERATING THE 8 CRITICAL KPIs - YOUR TOP PRIORITY:**
These exact metrics MUST be included in your response with actual values (NOT "N/A" unless absolutely impossible after exhaustive search):

1. **Revenue (TTM, INR)** - From screener.in "Sales" or latest quarterly results
2. **Profit Margin** - Calculate from Net Profit/Sales if not directly available
3. **EBIT Margin** - Operating Profit/Sales or from screener.in
4. **EPS (TTM)** - Earnings per share from screener.in or exchange filings
5. **ROE (Return on Equity)** - MANDATORY - Check screener.in "Return on Equity" field, Moneycontrol ratios, or annual report. If not found, provide Net Profit and Shareholder Equity separately so it can be calculated.
6. **ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)** - MANDATORY - Check screener.in "ROCE" field, Moneycontrol, or calculate from EBIT and Capital Employed. Provide raw numbers if direct % not available.
7. **Book Value / Share** - MANDATORY - Check screener.in "Book Value" field, NSE/BSE data, or company balance sheet. Provide Total Equity and Share Count if direct value not available.
8. **P/E Ratio** - Current Price/EPS, from screener.in or market data

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROE, ROCE, AND BOOK VALUE:**
These 3 metrics are FREQUENTLY missing. You MUST make extra effort:

**For ROE:**
- Primary: screener.in "Return on Equity %" (usually in ratios table)
- Secondary: Moneycontrol â†’ Company â†’ Financials â†’ Ratios â†’ "ROE %"
- Tertiary: Latest annual report - find Net Profit and Total Shareholder Equity, state both clearly
- Example output: "ROE is 12.5%" OR "Net Profit: â‚¹5,000 Cr, Shareholder Equity: â‚¹40,000 Cr (for ROE calculation)"

**For ROCE:**
- Primary: screener.in "ROCE %" (in compounded returns or ratios section)
- Secondary: Moneycontrol ratios page
- Tertiary: Calculate or provide EBIT and (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
- Example output: "ROCE is 15.2%" OR "EBIT: â‚¹8,000 Cr, Capital Employed: â‚¹50,000 Cr (for ROCE calculation)"

**For Book Value / Share:**
- Primary: screener.in "Book Value" (per share, in company overview or per-share data)
- Secondary: NSE/BSE company page "Book Value per Share"
- Tertiary: Latest balance sheet - Total Shareholder Equity divided by Outstanding Shares
- Example output: "Book Value per Share: â‚¹450.50" OR "Total Equity: â‚¹30,000 Cr, Outstanding Shares: 500 Cr (for Book Value calculation)"

**SEARCH EXHAUSTIVELY**: Visit screener.in company page, check the "Key Ratios" and "Profit & Loss" sections. If Indian company not on screener.in, use Moneycontrol or Investing.com India. For international companies, use Yahoo Finance or company investor relations, then convert to INR where applicable.

**DO NOT RETURN "N/A"** for these 8 KPIs unless you have genuinely exhausted all possible sources. These values are displayed prominently to users and "N/A" creates a poor experience. If you cannot find the final calculated metric, at minimum provide the raw financial data needed to calculate it (Net Profit, Equity, EBIT, Assets, Liabilities, Share Count).

**PRICE ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS**:
- For Indian companies: Get live/current price from NSE or BSE in Indian Rupees (â‚¹), cross-reference with screener.in
- For US companies: Get current NYSE/NASDAQ price in USD and convert to INR using current exchange rate (approximately 1 USD = 83-85 INR)
- For other international companies: Convert from local currency to INR
- Always specify the source and timestamp of price data
- **IMPORTANT**: If screener.in shows analyst targets or consensus price targets, include those specific numbers

**ANALYST TARGET VALIDATION**:
- Check screener.in for consensus price targets and analyst recommendations
- Find multiple analyst price targets if available from different brokerages
- Convert all targets to Indian Rupees
- Specify the source brokerage/analyst firm
- Include target timeframe (6 months, 12 months, etc.)
- Look for "Fair Value" estimates on screener.in

**EXCHANGE RATE CONTEXT** (use current rates):
- 1 USD â‰ˆ 83-85 INR
- 1 EUR â‰ˆ 90-92 INR  
- 1 GBP â‰ˆ 105-107 INR

Focus on the most recent data and provide specific numbers with sources. This analysis will be used to generate an investment recommendation for Indian investors with accurate pricing.`;
